#How to translate JClic.js

[JClic.js](https://projectestac.github.io/jclic.js) makes use of a small set of strings, mostly placed in button tooltips and user reports.

You can contribute to the project translating these texts into your language, or helping to revise the translations done by other people. To do this just go to the [jclic.js project in Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/francesc/jclicjs) and click on `Join team`. If your language or variant is not yet on the list, click on `Request language` to start a new translation.

Translations can be done directly on Transifex or locally editing a [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) file using [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/).

Thank you for collaborating in this free software project!
