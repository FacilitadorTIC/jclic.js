[JClic.js](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic.js) is an HTML5 player of [JClic](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic) activities. See a [demo](https://clic.xtec.cat/projects/demo_eng/jclic.js/index.html) on how it works.

## JClic and JClic-repo

[JClic](http://clic.xtec.cat) is a free software project from the [Catalan Educational Telematic Network](http://www.xtec.cat) (XTEC) for creating various types of interactive activities such as associations, puzzles, text activities, crosswords or puzzles, from elements of text, graphics and multimedia.

The program includes an authoring tool to create activities, a player and a reporting system that stores the results obtained by students. All these components, along with some guides and tutorials on how to create activities, are available in the [clicZone](http://clic.xtec.cat/en/jclic/download.htm).

JClic is a Java application that runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Full [source code](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic) and [documentation](http://projectestac.github.io/jclic/) are available on GitHub.

Many teachers from different countries have used JClic to create interactive materials for a wide variety of levels, subjects, languages and curriculum areas. Some of these materials have been collected in a huge [library](https://clic.xtec.cat/repo) created with [jclic-repo](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic-repo), another open source project that will facilitate the publication of collections of JClic projects in static web hosting services.

## How to build JClic.js

JClic.js uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) modules encapsulated in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages. First of all, you must have Node.js (which includes 'npm') [installed](https://nodejs.org/download/) on your system.


To install the required packages, just go to the project's root directory and write:

```
npm ci
```

This will install jQuery, Webpack and other needed components into `node_modules`

To build jclic.js, just invoke:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate the main file `dist/jclic.min.js` (along with other files useful for development)

To test this resulting bundle and see the demo on your browser, launch the webpack dev server:

```
npm start
```

This will launch a local HTTP server allowing to choose between pages in development mode (bundle build dynamically by [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)) and in production mode (serving the latest build on `/dist`)

You can also build this documentation running `npm run build-doc`

## JClic.js main classes

JClic.js is organized in three main groups of classes: _Player_, _Document_ and _Utilities_. In addition to this, the main [JClic](module-JClic.html) class provides methods to read JClic project documents, build players, launch activities and communicate with external reporting systems.

&nbsp;
#### Player

[JClicPlayer](module-JClicPlayer.JClicPlayer.html) loads JClic project files, manages the user interaction and acts as a interface between the browser and JClic classes for multiple functions. The player has:

* [Skin](module-skins_Skin.Skin.html): manages the visual appareance. Can have up to three [Counter](module-skins_Counter.Counter.html) objects.
  * [DefaultSkin](module-skins_DefaultSkin.DefaultSkin.html): is the basic implementation of _Skin_.
  * [BlueSkin](module-skins_BlueSkin.BlueSkin.html), [OrangeSkin](module-skins_OrangeSkin.OrangeSkin.html), [GreenSkin](module-skins_GreenSkin.GreenSkin.html), [MiniSkin](module-skins_MiniSkin.MiniSkin.html) and [SimpleSkin](module-skins_SimpleSkin.SimpleSkin.html): are the implementations of the stock skins of JClic.
* [PlayerHistory](module-PlayerHistory.PlayerHistory.html): used to track the user's navigation between activities.
* [Reporter](module-report_Reporter.Reporter.html): Used to collect and display scores, times and other data generated by users while playing activities.
  * [TCPReporter](module-report_TCPReporter.TCPReporter.html): Special case of _Reporter_ used to connect with external reporting systems like [JClic Reports] (http://clic.xtec.cat/en/jclic/reports/index.htm) or the [JClic module for Moodle](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?id=305).  
  * [SCORM](module-report_SCORM.SCORM.js): Utility functions to interact with SCORM 1.2 and 2004 when available
  * [SessionStorageReporter](module-report_SessionStorageReporter.SessionStorageReporter.html): writes the report as a persistent data into the browser session or local storage.

&nbsp;
#### Document classes

[JClicProject](JClicProject.html) encapsulates all data needed to play JClic activities. Its main components are:
* [ProjectSettings](ProjectSettings.html)
* A collection of [Activity](Activity.html) objects (see below)
* An [ActivitySequence](ActivitySequence.html) formed by [ActivitySequenceElement](ActivitySequenceElement.html) objects.
* A [MediaBag](MediaBag.html) formed by [MediaBagElement](MediaBagElement.html) objects.

The [Activity](Activity.html) class has the following subclasses:
* [SimpleAssociation](SimpleAssociation.html)
  * [ComplexAssociation](ComplexAssociation.html)
* [WrittenAnswer](WrittenAnswer.html)
* [MemoryGame](MemoryGame.html)
* [Explore](Explore.html)
* [Identify](Identify.html)
* [InformationScreen](InformationScreen.html)
* [DoublePuzzle](DoublePuzzle.html)
* [ExchangePuzzle](ExchangePuzzle.html)
* [HolePuzzle](HolePuzzle.html)
* [TextActivityBase](TextActivityBase.html) (see below)
  * [FillInBlanks](FillInBlanks.html)
  * [Complete](Complete.html)
  * [IdentifyText](IdentifyText.html)
  * [OrderText](OrderText.html)
* [CrossWord](CrossWord.html)
* [WordSearch](WordSearch.html)

All classes derived from [TextActivityBase](TextActivityBase.html) have:
* One [TextActivityDocument](TextActivityDocument.html)
* An [Evaluator](Evaluator.html)

At run time, all classes derived from [Activity](Activity.html) generate a specific [Activity.Panel](Activity.Panel.html), that is a real DOM object with wich users interact.
