{"name":"JClic.js","tagline":"HTML5 player of JClic activities","body":"#JClic.js\r\n\r\n[JClic.js](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic.js) is an HTML5 player\r\nof [JClic](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic) activities.\r\n\r\n## JClic\r\n\r\n[JClic](http://clic.xtec.cat) is an open source authoring system promoted by the Catalan Ministry of\r\nEducation ([XTEC](http://www.xtec.cat)) that allows the creation of interactive learning __activities__.\r\nThese activities can be puzzles (with different shapes and distributions), associations, memory games,\r\nscrambled letters, crosswords and several types of text activities (fill-in the gap, put in order\r\nwords or paragraphs, identify words or letters, etc.).\r\n\r\nGroups of single activities are often grouped in __JClic projects__ and organized in one or more\r\n__sequences__ (lists of activities that must be performed in a specific order). The resulting set of\r\nactivities, sequences and media elements are packaged into __JClic project files__ (files with\r\nextension \".jclic.zip\").\r\n\r\nSince 1995, the JClic project has a huge community of users and a\r\n[library](http://clic.xtec.cat/db/listact_en.jsp) of free JClic projects created by teachers of\r\ndifferent countries and shared under licenses of type _Creative Commons_.\r\n\r\nJClic has been developed in Java and has multiple [components](http://clic.xtec.cat/en/jclic/download.htm):\r\nauthoring tool, standalone player, applet, packaging and reporting system. The\r\n[source code](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic) and the [documentation](http://projectestac.github.io/jclic/)\r\nof JClic are freely available on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\n* This project is a work on progress. Only some basic features of JClic are implemented.\r\n* Text activities of type \"complete\", \"order\" and \"identify\" are not yet implemented.\r\n* Only a basic implementation of \"skin\" is provided, without counters nor buttons.\r\n* The JClic reporting system is not yet implemented.\r\n* Event sounds are not yet implemented.\r\n* Video playing and recording/playing of sounds are not yet implemented.\r\n* Playing of MIDI files is not yet implemented\r\n* Loading of big (about 10MB) JClic project files from zipped files can crash on tablets\r\nand mobile devices with low memory resources. This is due to a\r\n[known issue](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip/issues/135) of JSZip.\r\n* The project has been tested only with the latest versions of Chrome/Chromium and Firefox.\r\n\r\n## How to build JClic.js\r\n\r\nJClic.js uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) modules encapsulated in\r\n[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages. First of all, you must have Node.js\r\n(which includes 'npm' by default) [installed](https://nodejs.org/download/)\r\non your system.\r\n\r\nTo update `npm` to the latest version, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo npm install npm -g\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for automation of building tasks. You must globally install this\r\npackage running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install the remaining packages, just go to the project's root directory and run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install jQuery, Browserify and other needed components into `node_modules` \r\n\r\nTo build jclic.js, just run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate the file `jclic.min.js` into the `dist` folder.\r\n\r\nTo test the module and see the demo in your browser, just launch the test server running:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt server\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor full documentation of the API, see: [http://projectestac.github.io/jclic.js/doc/index.html]\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
