{"name":"JClic.js","tagline":"HTML5 player of JClic activities","body":"#JClic.js\r\n\r\n[JClic.js](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic.js) is an HTML5 player\r\nof [JClic](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic) activities.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\n* This project is a work on progress. By now, only some basic features of JClic are implemented.\r\n* Text activities of type \"complete\", \"order\" and \"identify\" are not yet implemented.\r\n* Only a basic implementation of \"skin\" is provided, without counters nor buttons.\r\n* The JClic reporting system is not yet implemented.\r\n* Event sounds are not yet implemented.\r\n* Video playing and recording/playing of sounds are not yet implemented.\r\n* Playing of MIDI files is not yet implemented\r\n* Loading of big (about 10MB) JClic project files from zipped files can crash on tablets\r\nand mobile devices with low memory resources. This is due to a\r\n[known issue](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip/issues/135) of JSZip.\r\n* The project has been tested only with the latest versions of Chrome/Chromium and Firefox.\r\n\r\n## How to build JClic.js\r\n\r\nJClic.js uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) modules encapsulated in\r\n[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages. First of all, you must have Node.js\r\n(which includes 'npm' by default) [installed](https://nodejs.org/download/)\r\non your system.\r\n\r\nTo update `npm` to the latest version run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo npm install npm -g\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for automation of building tasks, and\r\n[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) for dependency checking and grouping of\r\nmultiple JavaScript sources into one single file.\r\n\r\nYou must globally install these two packages by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo npm install -g grunt-cli browserify\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install the remaining packages, just go to the project's root directory and run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install JQuery and other needed packages into `node_modules` \r\n\r\nTo build jclic.js, just run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate the file `jclic.min.js` in the `dist` folder.\r\n\r\nTo test the module and see the demo in your browser, just launch the test server running:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt server\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
